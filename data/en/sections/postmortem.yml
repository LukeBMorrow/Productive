topics:
  - subject: "What was the overall architecture of your system?"
    summary: "
      \n- The **activities** load certain layouts to the screen
      \n- The **UI adapters** fill the dynamic portions of the layouts
      \n- The **adapters** get their data from the **logic** layer
      \n- The **logic** layer processes data from the **persistence** layer
      \n- And the **persistence** layer exists in the background.
      \n- **Executors** are in here somewhere, they act as an observer class, triggering things like updates in the **adapters** when new tasks are added to the **persistence** layer.\n"

  - subject: "Can you draw any conclusions from what you’ve done?"
    summary: "5 chefs don’t make the food arrive 5x faster. The communication and coordination overhead tax the performance of a team.  \n
      But with the coordination and communication prowess of our team, we saw the great potential for development speed improvements that come from working as a team."

  - subject: "What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?"
    summary: "Commit messages are important! It saves so much time if you can tell at a glance what part of what feature came from where."

  - subject: "How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?"
    summary: "The app came out fantastic. The scope of the app was just right, as to not need many features dropped. And the product developed into a real, bug free(to our knowledge), productivity tracking app."

  - subject: "Did any features work better than expected?"
    summary: "The features surrounding the core functionality of the app, i.e. the task, and how it gives users exp points and coins worked really well. This can also be chained to have “streaks” of completed tasks for bonus exp. "

  - subject: "What went right in the development process?"
    summary: "
      \n- Our estimates were pretty good. When either the time committed or the time estimated were over the other, it was still by a small margin
      \n- We planned our features well, to the extent that we didn’t have to cut any features from the final app "

  - subject: "What went wrong in the development process?"
    summary: "Because of time constraints, we were unable to design our own pixel art for the items users can buy with the coins they earn"

  - subject: "What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?"
    summary: "
    \n- Spend more time initially figuring out which parts of the project everyone wants/prefers to work on. The best development happens when everyone gets to stuff they’re passionate about.
    \n- Focus more on communication. Although we eventually got the communication down it took a little while. Good communication is the lifeblood of any significant team project."

  - subject: "Are there any outstanding bugs?"
    summary: "No outstanding bugs were found from our testing/usage"
